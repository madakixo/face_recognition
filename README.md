# face_recognition
The general pipeline of the app is as follows:

User Uploads Image: The user uploads an image via the web interface.

Image Preprocessing: The uploaded image is saved temporarily.

Face Detection (YOLO):

The image is passed through the YOLO object detection model to detect faces.

Bounding boxes around the faces are extracted.

Face Recognition:

Each detected face is passed to a face recognition model.

The model compares detected faces to known faces.

The name of the recognized person is returned (or "Unknown" if not recognized)

Annotation & Display:

The original image is annotated with bounding boxes and the names/labels.

The annotated image is displayed in the web browser.

##How to Run:

Ensure you have all the requirements pip install -r requirements.txt

Create the directory structure shown at the start.

Create a faces dir mkdir data/faces inside the face_recognition_app folder (this is for training purposes)

Add folders with the name of each individual to the data/faces dir. Inside of those directories, add the images to train from.

***Run the app:*** python app.py

Open your browser and go to **http://127.0.0.1:5000/**

Important Notes and Enhancements:

Training Your Face Recognition Model:

You'll need a face_recognition_model for recognition. The example above uses an SVM model that can be trained with face images 
in the specified data/faces directory, following the directory structure described. You could also use other models based on deep learning techniques.

This is not implemented in the code for brevity, but you can add a training script (see face_recognition.py). 
You will likely need a lot of high-quality face images of different people, including different angles and lightning.

**YOLO Improvements:**

You can tune confidence and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) thresholds in the face_detection.py.

YOLO is not specifically trained for face detection. Consider using a dedicated face detector for better performance 
like cv2.CascadeClassifier as an alternative to yolo.

_Face Recognition Improvements:_

You can use pre-trained models for better recognition.

Face embeddings via deep learning networks such as FaceNet or ArcFace for better performance.

Consider adding distance matching for verification and setting thresholds.

Error Handling:

Add more robust error handling for image loading, model loading, etc.

Real-time Processing: For real-time processing, optimize the app and consider using a different tech stack (e.g., WebSockets).

Security: This is a very basic app, so in production, ensure you have secure upload handling, etc.

UI: You can enhance the UI with CSS/JavaScript for a better user experience.

Next Steps:
1. Create all the necessary files and folders.
2. Implement the training of the face recognition model.
3. Add the functionality to load the trained models.
4. Test all your code.

This project is a comprehensive start to creating a face recognition application. Remember to adapt and enhance it for your 
needs! Let me know if you have any questions.
